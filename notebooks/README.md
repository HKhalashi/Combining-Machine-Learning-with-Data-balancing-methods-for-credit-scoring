## Notebooks Overview:

### 1. 01_UCI_Credit_Card_Analysis.ipynb
- **Description**: This notebook contains the analysis and machine learning experiments performed on the UCI Credit Card dataset. 
- **Key Steps**:
  - Data preprocessing and feature selection.
  - Application of various machine learning models (Random Forest, Neural Networks, etc.).
  - Evaluation using metrics such as Accuracy, AUC-ROC, Sensitivity, and Specificity.
  - Visualization of results and model performance.

### 2. 02_Default_Analysis.ipynb
- **Description**: This notebook contains the analysis and machine learning experiments performed on the Default dataset (a simulated credit dataset).
- **Key Steps**:
  - Data preprocessing and feature selection.
  - Application of various machine learning models.
  - Comparison of modelsâ€™ performance across different metrics.
  - Visualization and discussion of the results.

## How to Use:
1. Open each notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment.
2. Follow the steps in the notebooks to understand the data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation processes.
3. The notebooks contain the results and figures directly, so no need for separate files for results.

Each notebook is self-contained, providing an understanding of the experiments and the corresponding results.
